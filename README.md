# COVID-19 APP
For this app, when you press on a country, it will show the data of "NewConfirmed, TotalConfirmed, 
NewDeaths, TotalDeaths, NewRecovered, TotalRecovered, and Date" for each country. Using reac-native, this a 
multi-platform app and is receive the current covid-19 data from the covid19 api. I used geocoder so that
given the coordinates from clicking on a country, it will know which country it is and output that country's name.
With that country's name now given, it will be used for the covid-19 api to grab data from that country and display
it on a marker.
